<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Miyoko is a multipurpose bot created by 1 idiot with the goal to combine all of the features from different bots into 1 simple, compact bot. Miyoko focuses on design and usability most and can find a use in any discord server

### Features:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
